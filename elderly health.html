            <h2>MEDICATION MANAGEMENT</h2>
            <p>Managing medications is a major part of providing care to older adults. Polypharmacy is common in the
                elderly and is fraught with risks. A careful and systematic approach is needed for managing drug therapy
                in these patients, recognizing the patient's specific goals.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn about your health conditions and medicines. Talk with healthcare providers, read trustworthy
                    websites, join support groups.</li>
                <li>Maintain a medication list with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medication names including OTCs, supplements, herbal remedies</li>
                        <li>Who prescribed each prescription</li>
                        <li>The purpose of each medication and symptoms it should treat</li>
                        <li>How often and at what dose you take each</li>
                        <li>Are refills needed?</li>
                        <li>Update the list when you take something new, if a medicine is stopped or if your dosage
                            changes. Your
                            provider should review your medications so you're only taking those you need. Discuss
                            allergies or
                            problems you've had with medicines. Don't stop taking prescriptions without checking with
                            him/her first.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Read the Drug Facts label, package inserts or Patient Medicine Information leaflets which tell you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What the medicine is for</li>
                        <li>How to take your medicine</li>
                        <li>How often you should take it and what dosage</li>
                        <li>Side effects or allergic reactions</li>
                        <li>Warnings including who shouldn't take the medicine, when to stop use and ask a doctor, who
                            is at
                            increased risks of side effects</li>
                        <li>Storage instructions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use one pharmacy so your pharmacist can monitor your medications and check for drug interactions.
                </li>
                <li>Safely store medicines. Check expiration dates. Keep medications in the bottle/tube they came in so
                    dosage and directions are at hand. Keep medicines up and away from children. Never share your
                    prescriptions or take others' medications.</li>

            <h2>EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING</h2>
            <p>Emotional support is a crucial part of elderly care, mainly because taking care of an elderly person's
                emotional wellbeing, along with providing them with physical support, can significantly improve their
                overall quality of life. Furthermore, the importance of providing elderly patients with emotional
                support cannot be denied, especially since it has shown to improve good health and reduce stress amongst
                the elderly. <br>There are certain things that bring joy to our lives. For seniors, hobbies play a large
                role in their happiness because it gives them a sense of freedom. For many elderly folks, continuing the
                hobbies that bring them joy could get difficult due to their age. For instance, a person might love
                gardening but may find it difficult to continue with their hobby well into their old age.</p>

            <h2>COMMON OLD AGE PROBLEMS</h2>
            <p>Common conditions in older age include hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, back and neck pain
                and osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. As people
                age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.<br><br>Older age is also
                characterized by the emergence of several complex health states commonly called
                geriatric syndromes. They are often the consequence of multiple underlying factors and include frailty,
                urinary incontinence, falls, delirium and pressure ulcers.</p>

            <h2>OUTDOOR SAFETY</h2>
            <p>Checkups and preventive screenings are a good idea at any age, but especially as you get older.<br>Along
                with wisdom, age brings greater chances of health problems. You're more likely to get diseases like
                diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, and arthritis as the
                years
                pass.<br>Some of these conditions don't show symptoms until they've gotten worse.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Prevent health issues-</h4>For instance, if you do a routine check-up of sugar and cholesterol,
                    you
                    will know how likely you are to get diabetes/ cholesterol in the future. This is because, if you are
                    at the borderline, doctors advise you to control your sugar intake. Hence, you can have control over
                    your health.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Eliminates further growth of disease-</h4>Cancer is a disease where if you identify it later,
                    it can be hard to diagnose. Doing a regular body check-up can help doctors diagnose a disease before it poses
                    high risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Increases life span-</h4>By doing a regular check-up of your body and health, you can be assured of how
                    healthy you are. By taking the preventive advice from the doctor and following the doctor's
                    prescriptions can increase your lifespan as well.
